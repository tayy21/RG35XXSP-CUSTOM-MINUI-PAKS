# RG35XXSP-CUSTOM-MINUI-PAKS: PortMaster & Custom Drastic SDL port

This project brings two major enhancements to the **RG35XXSP running MinUI**:

1. **PortMaster Support** ‚Äî Easily install and manage ports.
2. **Improved DS Emulation** ‚Äî Adds a working Drastic SDL build with better layouts!

The work is based on a fork of [RGXX-Custom-MinUI-Paks](https://github.com/ryanmsartor/RGXX-Custom-MinUI-Paks), with contributions and enhancements tailored specifically for the **RG35XXSP**.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è While these enhancements were made for the RG35XXSP, they *may* work on other H700 devices (RG35XX+, RG35XXH), but this is **untested**. If you own one of these devices and can test, please let me know!

## üì¶ Additions

- `PortMaster.pak` ‚Äî Launches PortMaster to install ports.
- `AddPorts.pak` ‚Äî Syncs installed ports into MinUI's Tools section.
- `Drastic DS Emulator` ‚Äî Via SDL-based port.
- `wifi.pak` ‚Äî Add WiFi setup capabilities from within MinUI (can be temperamental).
- Supporting files in `Roms/APPS/` to enable PortMaster.

---

## üìÅ Installation Instructions

To install the included PAKs and supporting files:

1. **Copy the following folders from the .zip file in releases to the root of your MinUI SD card**:
    - `Emus/`
    - `Roms/`
    - `Tools/`

   > Choose **merge** if prompted. Do not delete existing folders.

2. **Add your ROMs** into the appropriate subfolders within `Roms/`.

3. **Safely eject the SD card and insert it into your RG35XXSP**.

## üåê Connecting to WiFi

PortMaster requires internet access. You can connect to WiFi in one of two ways:

### Method 1: Using Stock OS (More Reliable)

1. In MinUI, go to **Tools > Reboot into Stock**.
2. Once in Stock OS, connect to your WiFi as normal.
3. Navigate to **Apps > TF2** and select **Reboot into MinUI**.
4. Perform a **full reboot**.

### Method 2: Using `wifi.pak` in MinUI (Experimental)

1. In MinUI, go to **Tools > wifi**.
2. Attempt to connect via the built-in interface.
3. After connecting, perform a **full reboot**.

---

## üöÄ Using PortMaster

1. Ensure WiFi is working (there should be a wifi symbol next to the battery indicator).
2. Go to **Tools > PortMaster** and launch it.
3. When prompted:
    - Select **Yes** to update PortMaster.
    - Select **Yes** to install PortMaster runtimes.

   > ‚è≥ The runtime installation can take up to **25 minutes** depending on your internet. If you get an error after the 28th download, that's normal ‚Äî PortMaster should still work.

4. Once done, you‚Äôll be inside the PortMaster interface.
5. From here, install a game like **Apotris** under "Ready to Run Ports".
6. Exit PortMaster.

---

## ‚ûï Adding Installed Ports to MinUI

1. Go to **Tools > AddPorts**.
2. This will scan for new ports installed by PortMaster and add them as launchable entries in the Tools menu.
3. Example: After installing Apotris and launching AddPorts, a new **Apotris** entry will appear in **Tools**.

## üêõ Notes and Tips

- **Stardew Valley** works! Be sure to use the **32-bit version from Steam**.
- If Stardew‚Äôs UI scaling is off:
    1. Wait until the main menu loads.
    2. Hover over **Load**.
    3. Press **Up**, then **Right**, then **A**.
    4. This should correct the scaling.
- Some ports may take longer to boot ‚Äî this is normal.
